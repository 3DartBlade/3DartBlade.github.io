        <h2>Overview/Preface</h2>
        <p>
            Items can range from weapons, through tools and utilities to mundane, everyday items. How you use items is only limited by your imagination and the DM's willingness. You might spread some bullets on the floor to make another character slip, or use a weapon to poke at something.
        </p>
        <h2>Weapons</h2>
        <p>
            Weapons are usually used as... well, weapons. They need to be equipped and they can be used for different types of attacks, depending on the weapon. Weapons you're proficient with deal additional damage corresponding to your proficiency bonus, <b>while weapons you're not proficient with have a disatvantage on attacks</b> unlike in standard Dungeons & Dragons. See the Terms and Rules page for more information
