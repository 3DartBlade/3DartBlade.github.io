                    <li> <b>Constitution:</b> How resistant you are. Higher Constitution means you are tougher, harder to kill, harder to poison, harder to mind control etc. </li>
                    <li> <b>Intelligence:</b> How much knowledge you have. Higher Intelligence means you know more, you can call out fake facts, solve riddles, use <q>magic</q> more effectively etc.</li>
                    <li> <b>Wisdom:</b> How perceptive you are. Higher Wisdom means you can call out lies, spot things easier, notice enemies before they can attack etc.</li>
                    <li> <b>Charisma:</b> How good you are with people. Higher Charisma means you can convince people easier, tell more believeble lies, get on the good side of someone etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Ability Modifier:</b> Your ability modifier is the value you add to skill checks and attacks that use the ability.<div class="indent10px">It is calculated the following way: every two points above 10 your ability modifier increases by one, and below 10 it decreases. This means that an ability score of 8 will result in a modifier of -1, a score of 12 in a modifier of +1 and score of 10 in a modifier of 0. You can use the following formula to quickly calculate your modifier: modifier = floor((score - 10) / 2)</div><div class="indent10px">Usually having an ability score be on an odd number is a waste of points and should be avoided.</div></li>
            <li><b>Proficiency bonus:</b> You can add this value to skill checks with skills you're proficient with and to attack rolls with weapons you're proficient with.<div class="indent10px">The value starts at +2 and gets +1 added every 4 levels. So, from level 1-4 it's +2, from level 5-8 it's +3 and so on.</div></li>
            <li><b>Initiative:</b> At the start of combat each character rolls a d20 to determine their order in battle. In general, you also add your dexterity modifier. If it's a tie between players, the players decide the order. If it's a tie between NPC's, the DM decides the order. If it's a tie between a PC and an NPC, the DM and the Player have to come to an agreement</li>

        </ul>
