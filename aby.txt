Sci-Fi card game
You have basic currency and you have 'fragments'. 

Lore (world building):
Fragments are-... fragments... of a supermassive AI developed by the military, named "Moma", which was deemed too dangerous and was destroyed after the military suffered a data breach. However, not before hackers all over the world started breaking in and downloading it. Now the fragments are scattered all over the world. They've been sold on 'zero day markets' and such. The fragments have a unique copy protection that effectively makes it impossible to copy it without destroying the original, thus moving it. This means every fragment is unique and cannot be duplicated.
Fragments affect gameplay. Fragments are finite and you can have all of them meaning you can't collect more. Moma only requires (tbd)% of its fragments to be rebuilt as the rest can be 'guessed'. This means there are more fragments than the price of "Moma assembler" in the dark shop. 

Bosses:
The more fragments you have, the higher the chance of a boss appearing and the higher level they'll be. Bosses bet with fragments, meaning you can win more or lose yours. The higher level the boss, the more they cheat. You may refuse to fight a boss at the moment, but the game gets harder anyway, and without spending fragments, it's gonna become harder and harder to win. If you don't have fragments, a boss may appear who offers to bet with a fragment for money. 

Shops:
After, or even during a match, you have the ability to buy items that help you from the shop for basic currency, or you can visit the underground, dark web shop where you can spend fragments, or even straight up sell them for money (basic currency). You may go into debt for any reason. 
An item named "Moma assembler" can be bought from the dark shop for (tbd)% of all fragments that trivializes the gameplay, but it locks you into an ending. The more fragments you have, the more you can sell them for, as they become 'rare'. 

Story (presented to player):
The goal of the game is simply to amass enough money to pay off your daughter's debt. During the game, the player is given small hints that pursuing fragments is dangerous. The more fragments you have, the higher the chance that someone will offer to pay you a lot of money for all of your fragments. The more fragments you have, the higher the chance of assassination attempts against you. Above a certain number of fragments, the military will start triangulating your position based on your hard drive's unique ID. 

Meta gameplay:
You may attempt to attack your opponent at any time, but there's a security system up-and-running that stops and penalises any ongoing crimes, including but not limited to assault. During gameplay however, there's a possibility of a power outage that lets either of you do anything from obvious cheats to murder attempts. You can buy battery packs, armor, better weapons, corpse disposal etc. from the shops that allow you to avoid, stop, survive or commit crimes. Having Moma guarantees safety under any and all circumstances.
At any point during gameplay, you may trash your hard drive, which permanently destroys your fragments, unless uploaded to a 'cloud-bank'. This has to be done periodically above a certain fragment count to avoid being raided by the military. 
Beyond your physical well being, you have to worry about your cyber-security as well. Hackers may try to break into your cloud-bank to steal your fragments or to steal your money and ask for your fragments in exchange for it.
You can upload or download money to/from your cloud-bank. Online shopping requires your money to be online but some, well paying, challengers will only accept 'cash'. Both up- and downloading has a hefty "handling fee" so you want to avoid up- or downloading small amounts frequently. Items can be bought to increase your security, such as your cloud-bank's premium membership that increases your security (straight up lower the chances of an attack being successful) but your handling fee increases drastically in addition to an initial payment. You may unsubscribe from the membership free of charge, but it's incredibly complicated, annoying and time consuming.
Other ways of increasing you cyber-security include decoy accounts (a random one will be attacked), keygen login (accessing the account requires a key generated specifically on your device), VPN (your ip becomes randomised, making accessing the real one difficult), counter-strike (when hacked, there's a chance you will be able to initiate a counter hack, taking back your goods and maybe some more money too), fragmentation (store your data on several independent servers, making stealing all of it at once impossible) etc.

# Card types:

# Structure
Cards that describe an unmovable structure that usually gives passive bonuses.
- Occupies grid (size specified)
- Cannot be stacked
- Has Def. but no Atk.
- Becomes destroyed if any part is destroyed
- Costs Res.

# Unit
Cards that describes units that usually can be moved and attack the enemy.
- Occupies grid (1x1)
- Can be stacked
- Has Atk. but no Def.
- Costs Res.
- Can be used to initiate attack

# Action
Cards that describe a special action to be done immediately.
- Costs Res.
- Cannot be placed, only used

# Effect
Cards that describe a passive effect or a conditional one.
- Costs Res.
- Doesn't occupy grid space, but occupies an effect space instead
- Applies a constant, passive effect or does something special if a condition is fulfilled.

-----------------------------------------

# General rules:

"Unless stated otherwise" applies to all rules. Card descriptions always overwrite rules.
# Playing field
The playing field consists of an [[8x8 (gridsize)]] grid and [[5 (effectfield)]] effect fields per player. [[Card types#Structures|Structure]] and [[Card types#Unit|Unit]] cards may be deployed on the grid while [[Card types#Effect|Effect]] cards occupy an effect field.
[[Card types#Unit|Unit]] cards may occupy the same space as [[Card types#Structures|Structure]] cards. In that case, the [[Card types#Structures|Structure]] card gets destroyed first in case of an attack.

# Win conditions
(only one condition needs to be met)
- Each player has [[3 (playerhealth)]] health points that can be attacked by enemy [[Card types#Unit|Unit]] cards if no [[Card types#Structures|Structure]] or [[Card types#Unit|Unit]] cards are deployed. If a player's health reaches 0, they lose.
- The game has a chess clock that limits the total time a player can use to make decisions per game. If this timer runs out, the player loses.
- A player might forfeit the game, allowing the opponent to win. (This may be done in exchange for lessened losses if bets are present. Often referred to as a 'peace treaty')

# Resource
Often referred to as Res. [[5 (baseresgen)]] resource is generated at the start of each round that can be spent on deploying cards. Each card has a Res cost.

# Attacking
[[Card types#Unit|Unit]] cards may attack enemy [[Card types#Structures|Structure]] or [[Card types#Unit|Unit]] cards or enemy health if neither are present. If an attack is successful, the attacked card gets destroyed or the enemy loses a health point. To determine if an attack is successful, a [[6 (diesize)]] sided die must be rolled, the cell's combined Atk value added and the attacked cell's combined Def value subtracted. If the resulting value is greater than [[6 (diesize)]] / 2, the attack is successful. An attack may only be initiated if the attacker is in a non-diagonal neighbouring cell. A direct attack may only be initiated if the attacker is in the furthest row (closest to enemy).

# Movement
[[Card types#Unit|Unit]] cards may move instead of attacking. They may move 1 cell in any non-diagonal direction.

# Stacking
Stacking refers to the action of deploying multiple [[Card types#Unit|Unit]] cards on the same cell. Their combined Stk value must not exceed [[10 (basemaxstack)]] otherwise the deployment/movement cannot be done. Stacked cards may move as one or separately, but they must attack as one. If you want to move some but attack with others, you must move first.

# Effects
Effect cards are applied from left to right at the time specified on the card (i.e.: start of each round, on attack, etc.). **Effect cards cannot be reordered unless both are "Versatile" or empty!** Each effect field may only hold one effect card. Effect cards may only be discarded at will if they are "Versatile".

# Tags
Cards may have tags such as "Electronic", "Aerial", etc. Some cards may use these tags as a condition to their effects. (i.e.: All "Electronic" Unit cards have 1 more Atk)

# Variables
Cards may use constant values such as 1, 2 or 7250 or they may refer to values that can change during gameplay, such as "Cards deployed"(Refers to the entire grid), "Remaining Stk"(Applies to the cell the unit/structure is deployed on), "Time left in seconds"(Refers to the player's timer) or even "Current month"(Refers to real-life time)

# Graveyard
Cards that have been destroyed or discarded are sent to the graveyard. The graveyard is shared between players.
