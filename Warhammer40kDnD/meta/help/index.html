        <h2>Overview/Preface</h2>
        <p>
            On this page you will find explanations for <b>D&D terms, Warhammer terms</b> and the <b>changes</b> this homebrew version brings in.
        </p>
        <h2>Dungeons & Dragons terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Ability scores:</b> Ability scores are what define the capabilities of characters. They are the following:
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Strength:</b> How much muscle you have. Higher Strength means you can lift heavy stuff, run faster for longer, hit harder with melee weapons etc.</li>
                    <li> <b>Dexterity:</b> How much control you have over your body. Higher Dexterity means your hand trembles less allowing you to shoot more preciesely, better balance, better at squeezing through thight spaces etc.</li>
                    <li> <b>Constitution:</b> How resistant you are. Higher Constitution means you are tougher, harder to kill, harder to poison, harder to mind control etc. </li>
                    <li> <b>Intelligence:</b> How much knowledge you have. Higher Intelligence means you know more, you can call out fake facts, solve riddles, use <span class="rainbow">magic</span> more effectively etc.</li>
                    <li> <b>Wisdom:</b> How perceptive you are. Higher Wisdom means you can call out lies, spot things easier, notice enemies before they can attack etc.</li>
                    <li> <b>Charisma:</b> How good you are with people. Higher Charisma means you can convince people easier, tell more believeble lies, get on the good side of someone etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Ability Modifier:</b> Your ability modifier is the value you add to skill checks and attacks that use the ability.<div class="indent10px">It is calculated the following way: every two points above 10 your ability modifier increases by one, and below 10 it decreases. This means that an ability score of 8 will result in a modifier of -1, a score of 12 in a modifier of +1 and score of 10 in a modifier of 0. You can use the following formula to quickly calculate your modifier: modifier = floor((score - 10) / 2)</div><div class="indent10px">Usually having an ability score be on an odd number is a waste of points and should be avoided.</div></li>
            <li><b>Proficiency bonus:</b> You can add this value to skill checks with skills you're proficient with and to attack rolls with weapons you're proficient with.<div class="indent10px">The value starts at +2 and gets +1 added every 4 levels. So, from level 1-4 it's +2, from level 5-8 it's +3 and so on.</div></li>
            <li><b>Initiative:</b> At the start of combat each character rolls a d20 to determine their order in battle. In general, you also add your dexterity modifier. If it's a tie between players, the players decide the order. If it's a tie between NPC's, the DM decides the order. If it's a tie between a PC and an NPC, the DM and the Player have to come to an agreement</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Warhammer 40 000 terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li id="psyker"><b>Psykers</b> are creatures capable of harvesting the powers of <a href="warp">the Warp</a> to do <span class="rainbow">magic</span>. Which includes blowing up heads and shit. I will have to make a section about spells anyway, I'll come back and update this then.</li>
            <li id="warp"><b>The Warp:</b> The warp, the immaterium, the realm of chaos all refer to a dimension seperate from ours, where all emotions go through. This is the dimension which allows Faster Than Light Travel and gives psykers their powers. However this is also the dimension where the <a href="#chaosGods">Chaos Gods</a> reside and they may be able to corrupt you if you're using the Warp by any means, including having emotions.</li>
            <li id="chaosGods"><b>Chaos Gods:</b> The chaos gods are four gods residing in the <a href="#warp">Warp</a> each representing... its own thing... They are as follows: <a href="#khorne">Khorne the blood god</a>, <a href="#tzeentch">Tzeench the lord of change</a>, <a href="#nurgle">Nurgle the lord of decay</a> and <a href="#slaanesh">Slaanesh the prince of pleasure</a></li>
            <li id="khorne"><b>Khorne the blood god:</b> Khorne is the <a href="#chaosGods">chaos god</a> representing war, fighting, rage etc. Under their corruption you seek as much fighting and blood as you can. On the flipside, Khorne honors... well, honor above all else, meaning his disciplines will fight you face to face. No trickery, no backstabbing. <br>
            <q>Blood for the Blood God! Skulls for the Skull Throne!</q></li>
            <li id="tzeentch"><b>Tzeentch the lord of change:</b> Tzeentch is the <a href="#chaosGods">chaos god</a> representing change, confusion, <span class="rainbow">magic</span> interestingly enough, and birds. They really love birds. Under their corruption, you will become an excelent psyker and yearn change ig. Tzeentch has a grand plan... or maybe not. Tzeentch will confuse you so bad that you don't even know what's real and what isn't anymore. Or maybe you will. On the flipside, change can be good and brings hope. Hope for stuff to change.</li>
            <li id="nurgle"><b>Nurgle the lord of decay:</b> or as I like to call them, Grandpa Nurgle is the <a href="#chaosGods">chaos god</a> representing staleness, sameness and decay. Under their influence, you will plague the enemy with... plagues... That's about it... On the flipside, sameness can be good because... sweet release of death or something idk. But plagues are cool and nurglings are kinda cute</li>
            <li id="slaanesh"><b>Slaanesh the prince of pleasure:</b> Slaanesh is the <a href="#chaosGods">chaos god</a> representing pain, pleasure, excess. Under their corruption you will have many blood orgies while being pumped full of drugs. Slaanesh is the youngest of the <a href="chaosGods">chaos gods</a> since we actually know how they came to be. See <a href="#birthOfSlaanesh">the birth of Slaanesh</a> for more details. The flipside of Slaanesh is while an emotion can be bad, it can also be good. Shocking, I know.</li>
            <li id="birthOfSlaanesh"><b>The birth of Slaanesh:</b> is the event where the <a href="../../aeldari">Aeldari</a> had so much blood orgies pumped full of drugs because of boredom, that their collective emotions bundled up and made a <a href="slaanesh">god of having blood orgies pumped full of drugs</a>. That very same good then ate all their souls for breakfast, except for the ones that they didn't for various reasons including <q>But they're too far, away ;-;</q> and <q>They can have more blood orgies pumped full of drugs tho.</q> (definetly real quotes)</li>
        </ul>
