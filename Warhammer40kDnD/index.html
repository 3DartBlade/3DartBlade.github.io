        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>
            <h3><span class="indent10px" />Hi :3</h3>
            <span class="indent10px" />I thought the idea of playing a D&D campaign based in the world of Warhammer 40 000 would be really nice, but I didn't want to use other people's homebrew versions because I like to have full control over things, so I made this website for myself and friends who potentially want to play with me.<br>
            <span class="indent10px" />Think of this website as a Player's Guidebook for Warhammer 40k D&D, only more readable and more easily navigable... Hopefully...<br>
            <br>
            <span class="indent10px" />Oh, and a heads up! This site will most likely look bad on mobile, and the back button will definetly be way too small.
        </p>
        <h2>Information and materials</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./meta/help"><b>Help:</b></a> You can find information about D&D rules and terms, Warhammer 40k terms, and <b>changes to D&D rules</b> in the <a href="./meta/help">help</a> section. Every time a D&D or Warhammer term will be used or a new/changed rule will be mentioned, that word will also be a link to that page, or a link will be provided near. Hopefully I won't miss any.</li>
                <li><a href="./items"><b>Items:</b></a> You can find information about every item and item category that I made for the Warhammer 40k setting in the <a href="./items">items</a> section and it's sub-sections. I will be referring to various items or types of items throughout this page, and these words will be also a link to that page. Hopefully I wint miss any.</li>

                <li><b>Back button:</b> On every page other than this, there will be an <i>ugly</i> back button on the top left corner of the page that takes you to the page above the current page. This is not the same as your browser's back button, as this will take you to the page one folder before the current one. For example if you're in on the weapons subsection of the items section, (your URL will look something like "[...]/items/weapons") then the back button will take you back to the items section (your URL will change to "[...]/items")</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
