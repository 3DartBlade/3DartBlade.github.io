!!! Mc feels powerful when using demonic powers, so that's their motive for wanting hell's gate to open. Also Lucifer wants to be human !!!
!!! Being in demonic form is metaphor for transitioning !!!

6.) 4 angels killing
7.) lightnings

Beasts:
Satan
Anti-christ or False prophet - writing the mark of the beast on foreheads

Bowls:
1.) Pretty much the plague on the marked

3.) Even more blood water
4.) More fire
5.) More darkness

New Jerusalem, golden city

My version:

Events:
0.) Humanity starts research to open hell's gate to harvest demonic energy.
1.) Revelation to popes about Apocalypse (exact time of day) 
2.) Complete darkness 8 minutes after what the popes said
3.) Stars falling (the stars are grotesque angels) 
4.) The angels setting stuff on fire and killing people, causing waters to turn to blood
5.) The Angel's "cleansing" people turning them into angels
6.) The angels start the construction of 4 portals through which the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse will enter. 
7.) The Horsemen start hunting down the humans who use demonic powers, and the MC has to help them defeat the Horsemen 
8.) Christ comes down to earth, expecting to find new Jerusalem. But upon finding out that the horsemen were defeated and at least one demon is still alive - Lucifer - He sets out to destroy it, including it's host, the MC. The MC lets Lucifer consume all their life power in order to turn into a dragon and send Christ back to heaven by killing him, thus offsetting the Apocalypse. This ending is bittersweet bc the MC gets reborn as a demon - fusing with Lucifer - but at the cost of both of them dying to create a new creature half human half demon.

2016. May. 30. (Monday) 6:00: 
Christian priests across the world, including Pope Francis report seeing a revelation that say exact 7 days from now, meaning June 6. 6 AM Judgement day will come and the seven seals will be broken.

2016. May. 30- June 5.: 
Luke describes these days as people desperately buying supplies fleeing to bunkers, some people starting to live recklessly while others including Luke, Lilly and the governing bodies are denying it's realness and are continuing to live their lives normally. Police are busy catching the reckless people. 
Luke should go through these days individually for style (not mandatory). He meets a man named Draco in these 7 days.

2016. June 6. 6 AM: 
Luke and Draco meet up at Luke's favourite place to see if the world will really end. Luke tried his best to convince Lilly to come, but she said she has a million and one things to do in the house, and she doesn't care if the world is ending. At exactly 6 AM Draco smiles a little, but seemingly nothing happens. Although the sun has risen about half an hour ago, Draco says that they should watch the sunrise for a while before they leave. Luke refuses. Draco asks if he could at least take him to Lanesboro, since that's where he has stuff to do. Luke is a bit hesitant, but in the end, he agrees. It takes about 7 minutes to get there. When they get there after talking for a few seconds, Draco asks the time. Luke replies that it's 6:08 and as he looks up from his phone, he sees that everything went completely dark. Draco shouts "Haha, finally!". Luke immediately jumps in the car in a rush to get to Lilly. Draco jumps in as well. When they get to the shack, they find Lilly is alright if a little shocked. Draco tells them to quick, come look at the stars. Every star has started to fall from the sky as if they were actual falling stars. Draco jokingly says "wish something" to which Luke replies with "I wish everything's gonna be fine". Draco looks at Luke almost laughing and says "If you say it out loud, it won't come true"

2016. June 6.: Day 0 Post Incipit:
As the stars fall, one of them lands fairly close. Luke wants to investigate, but Draco tries to stop him. Before they get too close, they see wings. As they start to flap, it is revealed that there are in fact 7 of them in total. They are attached to something that looks vaguely human, but much skinnier, and as if it's skin melted from the fall and after it landed they froze again, fusing in the wrong places. It had no eyes. None that you could see, but it still managed to hover up and dash into a nearby house. Luke immediately turned tail, grabbed Lilly, jumped in the car and headed south-west, through a bridge to get to a lake next to the river, surrounded by trees. He felt they were safe there. Luke turns to Draco for advise. He explains that what they saw were angels falling down and that it's because the Apocalypse has started, and june 6. 6AM was Incipit, the beginning. Luke then asks Draco how he knows that, to which Draco smiles and says "Because I'm the devil". Before Luke could ask any questions Draco tells him that there's a way to kill the angels. Something holy can only be killed by something unholy. He says that the angels can only be killed with the power of devils, which luckily for Luke the most powerful of them is right in front of him. But there's a catch. Demons can't directly interfere with humans or divinity since they've been cast down to hell. What they CAN do however, is make a deal with a human and lend their power to them. The deal being that they get to use the demon's power, but it costs them their life. The powers themselves will eat away your life, likely shortening your lifetime. Draco says that he's basically giving it for free, but the power itself is the price. Luke asks him why he's helping out, and he says "only to spite that motherfucker up there."
 An angel approaches and Draco tries to hurry Luke. Luke shakes his hand at the last moment as the angel jumps on the top of the car crushing it. But the angel is soon knocked in the air along with the roof of the car as it's revealed that Luke has a big shield that's slightly transparent and is made of something black and red. The angel uses it's many wings to gain back it's balance mid air, before plunging down on Luke. As the angel quickly descends towards him, Luke punches it with his other hand which causes the angel to collapse on itself and explode it's guts everywhere. Angels from all around start shrieking, which Luke decides would be too many to fight and tries to start the car. With a missing roof, broken windshield and windows, and a hole where Luke was standing while fighting the angel, miraculously the car still starts, and he can drive away. On the road now, he sees that Lilly is alright, but Draco is nowhere to be found.

Characters:

Luke Dominic Barbarossa: 
Born: 1998, Jan. 20. Whalan, Minnesota
A boy whose alcoholic father killed his mother after finding out she cheated on him. With his father in prison and his mother dead, he was transferred to Seraphim Pines Orphanage in Lanesboro at only 6 years old where he met Lilly who became a close friend of his. They were abused sexually by the priests and physically by the nuns when they were teens (physically even before that). At that time, a man who said he "doesn't live far" visited the orphanage and offered to pay for a driving licence for Luke because "He will need it". Nobody knew the man, and he never came back, but Luke managed to get his licence. When he turned 18 he promised Lilly that he will come back for her before he was kicked out, forced to find a job, which he fortunately managed to do. He did food delivery from Preston foods. He even got a car from them. From that money, he rented a small, cheap (/shack) mobile home in Preston's mobile home park by the time Lilly turned 18 and was kicked out as well.

Lilly "Seraph" Edenson:
Born: 1998, May 28. Preston, Minnesota
Her mother was kicked out of her family at 18 for being rebellious. Starving, unable to find a job, she became a prostitute. She soon, unintentionally, became pregnant by one of her clients. Due to her suffering from malnutrition and being young, she died in childbirth. Lilly was transferred to Seraphim Pines Orphanage, Lanesboro, Minnesota and lived her life there. The nuns at the orphanage named her Lilly and gave her the nickname "Seraph", presumably based on the orphanage's name. She met Luke in April of 2004 when he was transferred there too. They became friends, because they were the only ones about that same age. She became "used to" the physical abuse, since that's the only thing she knew since birth, but Luke showed her that love and understanding exists too. They were holding out for each other. As teens they were both sexually molested by the priests and even the nuns. Before Luke became 18 and got kicked out, he promised Lilly to come back for her. Those 4 months were incredibly lonely for her, with nobody to calm her down. When she turned 18, as she left the orphanage, she saw Luke waiting for him in a car. Luke took her home, and nowadays she's looking for a job, but in the meantime she acts as a housewife, making food and cleaning the shack.
